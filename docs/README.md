# Workout_Analysis
An analysis of my workout routine of 2024, 2025 data collection in progress.

### 2024 Analysis takeaways
- Am using a spreadsheet that will require no cleaning in terms of column names and dimentions. Furthermore, the exercise naming convetion is to be as consistent as possible
- Have an exercise frequency plot, weight moved plot, and a calendar gym frequency plot.
- Any further analysis or modeling is to be frozen along with  application and report. This is something that needs to be completed to fulfill the vision of the project, but my knowledge in gym exercises has shifted the important or application itself.
- For the report, I'd like it to cover change from beginning to end of the year, what months were the best/worse in terms of frequency and weight moved. Believe the best course of action will be to work backwards starting with the report, and identifying what is needed.
